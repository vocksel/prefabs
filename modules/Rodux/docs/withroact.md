Rodux stands well on its own and does not require any additional libraries. However, Rodux can be particularly useful when developing Roact applications. It is difficult to represent global state in Roact without passing a lot of data up and down the Roact DOM. [`RoactRodux`](https://github.com/Roblox/roact-rodux) allows us to connect individual Roact components to our Rodux store, simplifying the management of our application's global state.
